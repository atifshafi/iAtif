- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @iAtif
- I am a programmer by heart, tester by profession. I love software development as much as I love finding bugs. To hone my development skills, my latest personal projects include a web app that connects travel enthusiasts around the world to post their idiosyncratic pictures, a news app, made on android, to keep you updated with the world of tech. Currently, I am developing a micro-services architecture based web app.
